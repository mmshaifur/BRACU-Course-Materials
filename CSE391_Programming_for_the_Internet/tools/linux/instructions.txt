How do I install XAMPP?
==========================================
    Choose your flavor for your linux OS, the 32-bit or 64-bit version.

    Change the permissions to the installer

    chmod 755 xampp-linux-*-installer.run

    Run the installer

    sudo ./xampp-linux-*-installer.run

    Also, note that there is a graphical tool that you can use to start/stop your servers easily. You can start this tool with the following commands:

How do I backup/restore my XAMPP system?
==========================================

    Warning: The backup and restore functionality is still under development and may not work correctly.

    You can create the backup by calling:

    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp backup

    or

    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp backup secret

    Where "secret" is your MySQL root password. This command will create the following output:

    Backing up databases...
    Backing up configuration, log and htdocs files...
    Calculating checksums...
    Building final backup file...
    Backup finished.
    Take care of /opt/lampp/backup/xampp-backup-22-01-14.sh

    The file /opt/lampp/backup/xampp-backup-22-01-14.sh (in the example above) contains your backup data. Store this file in a safe place.

    On the new machine you need the same version of XAMPP as on your original/source machine.

    sudo sh xampp-backup-22-01-14.sh

    You should see something like this:

    Checking integrity of files...
    Restoring configuration, log and htdocs files...
    Checking versions...
    Installed: XAMPP 1.4.2
    Backup from: XAMPP 1.4.2
    Restoring MySQL databases...
    Restoring MySQL user databases...
    Backup complete. Have fun!
    You may need to restart XAMPP to complete the restore.

    That's all. Keep in mind that it's a beta feature.
