2.1.1 Windows
To install JFlex on Windows 95/98/NT/XP, follow these three steps:


1. Unzip the file you downloaded into the directory you want JFlex in (using something
like WinZip2). If you unzipped it to say C:\, the following directory structure should be
generated:

C:\jflex-\ver\
+--bin\ (start scripts)
+--doc\ (FAQ and manual)
+--examples\
+--byaccj\ (calculator example for BYacc/J)
+--cup\ (calculator example for cup)
+--interpreter\ (interpreter example for cup)
+--java\ (Java lexer specification)
+--simple-maven\ (example scanner built with maven)
+--standalone-maven\ (a simple standalone scanner, built with maven)
+--lib\ (precompiled classes, skeleton files)
+--src\
+--main\java\
+--jflex\ (source code of JFlex)
+--jflex\gui (source code of JFlex UI classes)
+--java_cup\runtime\ (source code of cup runtime classes)
+--main\jflex\ (JFlex scanner spec)
+--main\cup\ (JFlex parser spec)
+--main\resources\ (messages and default skeleton file)
+--test\ (unit tests)


2. Edit the le bin\jflex.bat (in the example it's C:\JFlex\bin\jflex.bat) such that
JAVA HOME contains the directory where your Java JDK is installed (for instance C:\java) 
and JFLEX HOME the directory that contains JFlex (in the example: C:\JFlex)


3. Include the bin\ directory of JFlex in your path. (the one that contains the start script,
in the example: C:\JFlex\bin).
